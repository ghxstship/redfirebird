                  GHXSTSHIP Industries is the parent. LYTEHAUS Technologies — operating ATLVS, GVTEWAY, and COMPVSS — is
                  the software arm we built so we&apos;d stop running production on spreadsheets.

                <p>
                  ATLVS is the producer&apos;s console. GVTEWAY is the stakeholder portal. COMPVSS is the offline-first
                  field app. The same data model powers all three. The same data model publishes this catalog.

                  When we tell a client we&apos;re running their engagement on the same system that publishes the
                  catalog they read before they hired us, we mean it literally. Same vendor records. Same compliance
                  framework. Same deliverable definitions.
